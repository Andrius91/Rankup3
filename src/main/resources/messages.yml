  # It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED you override these in rankups.yml

  # however if you are just using money, you can use {MONEY} or {MONEY_NEEDED} or {PERCENT_DONE} or {PERCENT_LEFT}
  # for example:
  #ranks:
  #  complete: "&7{OLD_RANK} &8\xbb &7{RANK} &efor &7${MONEY}"
  #  current: "&c{OLD_RANK} &e\xbb &c{RANK} &efor &a${MONEY} &e{PERCENT_DONE}%"
  #  incomplete: "&r{OLD_RANK} &e\xbb &r{RANK} &efor &a${MONEY}"
  ranks:
